# FantasyMash
Idea based on Zuckerberg's "FaceMash"

# General Idea
Create a platform/app that allows users to get a better idea of their fantasy football rankings (and eventually any rankings) through 1:1 matchups and an elo system.

General Flow:
- Give users to players to pick between (they pick which one they would rather draft on their fantasy team)
- Increment each players "elo" (the picked player moves up, the unpicked player moves down)
- Rinse and repeat until the user has a very detailed and accurate rankings list based on actual choices they've made over time
